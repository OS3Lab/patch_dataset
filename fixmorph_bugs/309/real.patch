Subject: [PATCH] tuntap: fix multiqueue rx

[ Upstream commit 8ebebcba559a1bfbaec7bbda64feb9870b9c58da ]

When writing packets to a descriptor associated with a combined queue, the
packets should end up on that queue.

Before this change all packets written to any descriptor associated with a
tap interface end up on rx-0, even when the descriptor is associated with a
different queue.

The rx traffic can be generated by either of the following.
  1. a simple tap program which spins up multiple queues and writes packets
     to each of the file descriptors
  2. tx from a qemu vm with a tap multiqueue netdev

The queue for rx traffic can be observed by either of the following (done
on the hypervisor in the qemu case).
  1. a simple netmap program which opens and reads from per-queue
     descriptors
  2. configuring RPS and doing per-cpu captures with rxtxcpu

Alternatively, if you printk() the return value of skb_get_rx_queue() just
before each instance of netif_receive_skb() in tun.c, you will get 65535
for every skb.

Calling skb_record_rx_queue() to set the rx queue to the queue_index fixes
the association between descriptor and rx queue.
