Subject: [PATCH] drm/amdkfd: Don't report local memory size

commit 42e08c78360e58516b6ac8af18a75a494f2967a2 upstream.

This patch sets the local memory size that is reported to userspace to 0.
This is done to make sure that userspace won't try to allocate local memory
for HSA.

As long as amdkfd doesn't support allocating local memory for HSA,
we need this patch.
