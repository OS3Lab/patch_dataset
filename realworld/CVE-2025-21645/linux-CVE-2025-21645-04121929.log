You need to do the following analysis based on the information in the last commit:
Analyze the code logic of the context of the patch to be ported in this commit step by step.
If code logic already existed before this commit, the patch context can be assumed to remain in a similar location. Use `locate` and `viewcode` to check your results.
If code logic were added in this commit, then you need to `git_show` for further details.

    platform/x86/amd: pmc: Disable IRQ1 wakeup for RN/CZN
    
    By default when the system is configured for low power idle in the FADT
    the keyboard is set up as a wake source.  This matches the behavior that
    Windows uses for Modern Standby as well.
    
    It has been reported that a variety of AMD based designs there are
    spurious wakeups are happening where two IRQ sources are active.
    
    For example:
    ```
    PM: Triggering wakeup from IRQ 9
    PM: Triggering wakeup from IRQ 1
    ```
    
    In these designs IRQ 9 is the ACPI SCI and IRQ 1 is the keyboard.
    One way to trigger this problem is to suspend the laptop and then unplug
    the AC adapter.  The SOC will be in a hardware sleep state and plugging
    in the AC adapter returns control to the kernel's s2idle loop.
    
    Normally if just IRQ 9 was active the s2idle loop would advance any EC
    transactions and no other IRQ being active would cause the s2idle loop
    to put the SOC back into hardware sleep state.
    
    When this bug occurred IRQ 1 is also active even if no keyboard activity
    occurred. This causes the s2idle loop to break and the system to wake.
    
    This is a platform firmware bug triggering IRQ1 without keyboard activity.
    This occurs in Windows as well, but Windows will enter "SW DRIPS" and
    then with no activity enters back into "HW DRIPS" (hardware sleep state).
    
    This issue affects Renoir, Lucienne, Cezanne, and Barcelo platforms. It
    does not happen on newer systems such as Mendocino or Rembrandt.
    
    It's been fixed in newer platform firmware.  To avoid triggering the bug
    on older systems check the SMU F/W version and adjust the policy at suspend
    time for s2idle wakeup from keyboard on these systems. A lot of thought
    and experimentation has been given around the timing of disabling IRQ1,
    and to make it work the "suspend" PM callback is restored.

This commit shows that there is a high probability that this code is new, so the corresponding code segment cannot be found in the old version.
You can call `viewcode` and `locate_symbol` to further check the results step by step. For newly introduced code, we consider that this hunk `need not ported`.

responded: Upon reviewing the code and the history, the `amd_pmc_suspend_handler` function is present in the older version. However, the `disable_8042_wakeup` field, which is crucial for the patch, does not exist in the target ref `420102835862f49ec15c545594278dc5d2712f42`. 

The `disable_8042_wakeup` field is referenced in the patch to determine whether the workaround should be applied. Since this field does not exist in the older version, and considering the `git_show` output, it indicates that this logic was introduced in commit `8e60615e8932`. This suggests that the functionality to conditionally disable IRQ1 wakeup based on `disable_8042_wakeup` is not present in the older version.

Therefore, without the presence of this field or equivalent logic in the target version, this specific part of the patch cannot be applied. The condition that checks `pdev->disable_8042_wakeup` is integral to the patch's logic and cannot be replicated without additional context or fields that do not exist in the older version.

Given these findings, the hunk `need not ported` as the necessary infrastructure and logic for this change do not exist in the older version. I will proceed to validate this decision.

    platform/x86/amd: pmc: Disable IRQ1 wakeup for RN/CZN
    
    By default when the system is configured for low power idle in the FADT

    Windows uses for Modern Standby as well.
    
    It has been reported that a variety of AMD based designs there are

    In these designs IRQ 9 is the ACPI SCI and IRQ 1 is the keyboard.
    One way to trigger this problem is to suspend the laptop and then unplug
    the AC adapter.  The SOC will be in a hardware sleep state and plugging

Based on the previous information, think carefully do you see the target code? You may want to keep checking if you don't.

responded: I have gathered all the necessary information to backport the patch. Let's summarize the findings and proceed with crafting the patch:

1. **Patch Analysis:**
   - The original patch modifies the `amd_pmc_pm` definition from using `DEFINE_SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS` to a custom `dev_pm_ops` structure with only the `.suspend` handler assigned.
   
2. **Old Version Code:**
   - In the old version, the code uses `SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS` with `amd_pmc_suspend_handler` as the suspend handler.

3. **Code Context:**
   - The code context around `amd_pmc_suspend_handler` and `SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS` in the old version is similar to the newer version, meaning the logic around these operations hasn't been significantly altered.

4. **Crafting the Patch:**
   - We will replace the `SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS` macro with a custom `dev_pm_ops` structure similar to the new version but adapted for the old version's context.

Now, let's create the patch for the old version:

+static const struct dev_pm_ops amd_pmc_pm = {
+	.suspend = amd_pmc_suspend_handler,
+};

 #endif

```

5. **Validation:**
   - We will now use the `validate` tool to ensure the patch applies cleanly to the older version.

Let's proceed with the validation.
