You need to do the following analysis based on the information in the last commit:
Analyze the code logic of the context of the patch to be ported in this commit step by step.
If code logic already existed before this commit, the patch context can be assumed to remain in a similar location. Use `locate` and `viewcode` to check your results.
If code logic were added in this commit, then you need to `git_show` for further details.

    platform/x86/amd: pmc: Disable IRQ1 wakeup for RN/CZN
    
    By default when the system is configured for low power idle in the FADT
    the keyboard is set up as a wake source.  This matches the behavior that
    Windows uses for Modern Standby as well.
    
    It has been reported that a variety of AMD based designs there are
    spurious wakeups are happening where two IRQ sources are active.
    
    For example:
    ```
    PM: Triggering wakeup from IRQ 9
    PM: Triggering wakeup from IRQ 1
    ```
    
    In these designs IRQ 9 is the ACPI SCI and IRQ 1 is the keyboard.
    One way to trigger this problem is to suspend the laptop and then unplug
    the AC adapter.  The SOC will be in a hardware sleep state and plugging
    in the AC adapter returns control to the kernel's s2idle loop.
    
    Normally if just IRQ 9 was active the s2idle loop would advance any EC
    transactions and no other IRQ being active would cause the s2idle loop
    to put the SOC back into hardware sleep state.
    
    When this bug occurred IRQ 1 is also active even if no keyboard activity
    occurred. This causes the s2idle loop to break and the system to wake.
    
    This is a platform firmware bug triggering IRQ1 without keyboard activity.
    This occurs in Windows as well, but Windows will enter "SW DRIPS" and
    then with no activity enters back into "HW DRIPS" (hardware sleep state).
    
    This issue affects Renoir, Lucienne, Cezanne, and Barcelo platforms. It
    does not happen on newer systems such as Mendocino or Rembrandt.
    
    It's been fixed in newer platform firmware.  To avoid triggering the bug
    on older systems check the SMU F/W version and adjust the policy at suspend
    time for s2idle wakeup from keyboard on these systems. A lot of thought
    and experimentation has been given around the timing of disabling IRQ1,
    and to make it work the "suspend" PM callback is restored.

This commit shows that there is a high probability that this code is new, so the corresponding code segment cannot be found in the old version.
You can call `viewcode` and `locate_symbol` to further check the results step by step. For newly introduced code, we consider that this hunk `need not ported`.

responded: The function `amd_pmc_suspend_handler` is located at line 833 in the older version, and the code block is visible from lines 833 to 853. From the `git_history` and `git_show`, it's evident that the logic related to `pdev->disable_8042_wakeup` was introduced in a later commit and does not exist in this older version.

The original patch in the newer version involves checking `pdev->disable_8042_wakeup` within the `amd_pmc_suspend_handler` function, which is not present in the older version. Since this specific logic was introduced in the commit `8e60615e8932`, and the function `amd_pmc_suspend_handler` in the older version only checks for `pdev->cpu_id == AMD_CPU_ID_CZN`, it confirms that this logic does not exist in the older version.

Therefore, the hunk from the newer patch does not apply to the older version because the relevant logic (`pdev->disable_8042_wakeup`) is entirely absent. Thus, this hunk `need not ported`.

Let's proceed to validate this decision.

responded: Based on the information gathered, I have identified the location of the target code in the older version of the file. Here's the plan:

1. **Context and Code Analysis**:
   - The new patch changes the way the `amd_pmc_pm` is defined from `SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS` to using a more explicit `dev_pm_ops` structure with only the `.suspend` handler.
   - In the older version, the code is using `SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS(amd_pmc_pm, amd_pmc_suspend_handler, NULL);`.

2. **Code Location**:
   - The `amd_pmc_suspend_handler` is located at line 833 in the older version of the file, and the `SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS` is defined shortly after at line 856.

3. **Patch Creation**:
   - I will create a patch that modifies the `SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS` to use the `dev_pm_ops` structure as seen in the newer version.

Here's the patch I will create for the older version:

```diff
--- a/drivers/platform/x86/amd/pmc.c
+++ b/drivers/platform/x86/amd/pmc.c
@@ -856,7 +856,9 @@

+static const struct dev_pm_ops amd_pmc_pm = {
+	.suspend = amd_pmc_suspend_handler,
+};
 
 #endif
 
```

Next, I will validate this patch to ensure it applies cleanly and resolves the issue in the older version.

This patch modifies the power management operations to use a more explicit `dev_pm_ops` structure, aligning it with the changes made in the newer version to address the security issue. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask![0m
