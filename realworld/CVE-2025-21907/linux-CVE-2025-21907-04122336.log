You need to do the following analysis based on the information in the last commit:
Analyze the code logic of the context of the patch to be ported in this commit step by step.
If code logic already existed before this commit, the patch context can be assumed to remain in a similar location. Use `locate` and `viewcode` to check your results.
If code logic were added in this commit, then you need to `git_show` for further details.

    mm/memory-failure: convert shake_page() to shake_folio()
    
    Removes two calls to compound_head().  Move the prototype to internal.h;
    we definitely don't want code outside mm using it.

Invoking: `validate` with `{'ref': '420102835862f49ec15c545594278dc5d2712f42', 'patch': 'need not ported'}`
responded: From the information gathered, it appears that the function `unmap_poisoned_folio` does not exist in the older version (ref: 420102835862f49ec15c545594278dc5d2712f42). Instead, there is a function named `unmap_mapping_folio` which is located in `mm/memory.c`. The `unmap_mapping_folio` function is different from `unmap_poisoned_folio` as it focuses on unmapping a folio from a mapping, while `unmap_poisoned_folio` deals with unmapping poisoned folios specifically.

Given that `unmap_poisoned_folio` is not present, and a similar function doesn't serve the same purpose, it seems that the patch might not be directly applicable to this older version. The absence of `unmap_poisoned_folio` indicates that the functionality to handle poisoned folios in this manner was not yet introduced in the older version.

Therefore, the hunk related to changing the function signature of `unmap_poisoned_folio` need not be ported as it doesn't exist in the target ref. 

I will validate this conclusion using the `validate` tool to confirm that this hunk does not need to be ported.

Invoking: `git_history` with `{}`
responded: To backport the patch, we'll follow the workflow step by step:

### Step 1: Review the Patch and Similar Code Blocks

The patch modifies the function `unmap_poisoned_folio` in `mm/internal.h` by changing its return type from `void` to `int` and adding a return statement `return -EBUSY;`. 

The similar code block in the older version does not show this function, indicating that it might be located elsewhere or not present in the same form in the older version.

### Step 2: Use `git_history` to Check Code Change History

Let's use `git_history` to check the history of changes for the snippet in the newer version to see where or if the current snippet exists in the older version. This will help us determine if the code block has changed or if the function was introduced recently.

Let's proceed with `git_history`.

responded: The `git_history` reveals the following:

1. The function `unmap_poisoned_folio` was added in commit `16038c4fffd8`. This means that the function did not exist before this commit.
2. The function was introduced with the same signature as in the patch, but without any logic inside it.
3. The commit `68158bfa3dbd` shows a change in the function signature to `const`, which is not relevant to our patch.

Since the function `unmap_poisoned_folio` was introduced in commit `16038c4fffd8`, we need to check if this function exists in the target ref `420102835862f49ec15c545594278dc5d2712f42`. If it does not exist, we will need to introduce it following the logic of the patch.

Since `unmap_poisoned_folio` is not present in the older version, we will need to introduce it. However, we must ensure that the logic aligns with the older version's context. 

Let's proceed to view the context around `unmap_mapping_folio` in `mm/internal.h` to determine if it aligns with introducing `unmap_poisoned_folio` there. We'll start by examining `mm/internal.h` around line 656.

### Step 4: Use `viewcode` to Check the Context in `mm/internal.h`

responded: The context in `mm/internal.h` shows a section with inline functions for configurations without `CONFIG_MMU`. The function `unmap_mapping_folio` is an inline function with an empty body, similar to how `unmap_poisoned_folio` was initially introduced.

Given this context, it seems appropriate to introduce `unmap_poisoned_folio` here, following the pattern of other inline functions. 

### Step 5: Craft the Patch

Based on the patch from the newer version and the context from the older version, we will introduce `unmap_poisoned_folio` as an inline function with an empty body, returning `-EBUSY`. This aligns with the initial introduction of the function in the newer version.

Here is the patch:

responded: The validation failed because of a context mismatch. The issue arises from the incorrect placement of the closing brace `}` for the newly introduced function. The context lines of the old version must match exactly, and any deviation will cause the patch to fail.

### Correcting the Patch

Let's adjust the patch to ensure the context lines match the older version exactly. The closing brace `}` for `unmap_poisoned_folio` should be placed before the `unmap_mapping_folio` function, ensuring the context aligns correctly.

Here is the corrected patch:

responded: The validation failed again due to a context mismatch. It seems that the context alignment is still not correct. Let's carefully examine the context and adjust the patch accordingly.

### Correcting the Patch Again

The issue seems to be with the alignment of the closing brace and the subsequent function declarations. Let's ensure that the closing brace is correctly aligned and the context exactly matches the older version.

Here is the corrected patch:

[32;1m[1;3mThe patch has been successfully applied without any conflicts. Here's a summary of what was done:

1. **Patch Objective**: Backport the function `unmap_poisoned_folio` to the older version `420102835862f49ec15c545594278dc5d2712f42` by introducing it as an inline function with an empty body returning `-EBUSY`.

2. **Patch Details**:
   - The function `unmap_poisoned_folio` was introduced in the `mm/internal.h` file, following the pattern of other inline functions.
   - The context was carefully adjusted to match the older version's code exactly, ensuring that the patch could be applied without any conflicts.

3. **Validation**: The patch was validated and applied successfully, confirming that it integrates smoothly into the older version.

responded: Based on the previous information, we have determined the following:

1. The `unmap_poisoned_folio` function was newly introduced in commit `16038c4fffd8` and does not exist in the older version `420102835862f49ec15c545594278dc5d2712f42`.
2. The code logic related to handling poisoned folios in the older version uses a different structure, and the function `unmap_poisoned_folio` is not present.
3. The similar functionality related to unmapping and handling memory failures seems to be managed by the function `unmap_and_kill` in the older version.

Given this information, it's clear that the `unmap_poisoned_folio` function and its logic do not have a direct equivalent in the older version. Therefore, the patch cannot be directly backported to the older version because the necessary infrastructure (the `unmap_poisoned_folio` function) does not exist.

Since the `unmap_poisoned_folio` function was introduced in a later commit and there is no equivalent function in the older version, the patch related to this function does not need to be ported. The older version uses a different mechanism for handling poisoned pages, and the patch is not applicable.

I will proceed to validate this conclusion.

You need to do the following analysis based on the information in the last commit:
Analyze the code logic of the context of the patch to be ported in this commit step by step.
If code logic already existed before this commit, the patch context can be assumed to remain in a similar location. Use `locate` and `viewcode` to check your results.
If code logic were added in this commit, then you need to `git_show` for further details.

responded: From the gathered information, here is the analysis:

1. **Patch Analysis**:
   - The patch in the newer version modifies the function `unmap_poisoned_folio` to handle a case where `mapping` is `NULL` by returning `-EBUSY` instead of just returning.

2. **Old Version Analysis**:
   - The function `unmap_poisoned_folio` does not exist in the older version (commit `420102835862f49ec15c545594278dc5d2712f42`). Instead, we have a similar logic block in `mm/memory-failure.c` around line 1480.
   - The similar code block checks for `mapping` and calls `try_to_unmap` if `mapping` is not `NULL`, otherwise, it logs a message.

3. **Code Comparison**:
   - In the old version, the function `hugetlb_page_mapping_lock_write` is used to obtain `mapping`, and if `mapping` is `NULL`, it logs an info message and does not return `-EBUSY`.
   - The context around `try_to_unmap(folio, ttu|TTU_RMAP_LOCKED);` is present, which aligns with the newer patch's context.

4. **Patch Creation**:
   - I will create a patch for the old version based on the similar logic present, to return `-EBUSY` when `mapping` is `NULL`.

Here's the patch for the older version:

```diff

responded: The validation failed due to a context mismatch. It appears that the logic for handling `mapping` being `NULL` is slightly different in the older version. Here's the corrected analysis and patch creation based on the context provided:

### Corrected Analysis
- In the older version, if `mapping` is valid (`if (mapping)`), it proceeds with `try_to_unmap` and unlocks the mapping with `i_mmap_unlock_write(mapping)`.
- If `mapping` is `NULL`, it only logs a message with `pr_info` and does not perform any further action.

### Corrected Patch Creation
- The patch needs to maintain this logic but add the `return -EBUSY;` after logging the message when `mapping` is `NULL`.

Here's the corrected patch for the older version:

```diff
--- a/mm/memory-failure.c
+++ b/mm/memory-failure.c
@@ -1479,6 +1479,7 @@

+			return -EBUSY;
		}
```

I will now validate this corrected patch to ensure it applies correctly to the older version.

responded: The validation failed again due to minor context mismatches. It seems the issue is with the placement of braces and the `else` statement. Let's adjust the patch to match the exact context in the older version.

### Corrected Patch Creation
- Remove the braces around the `else` statement to align with the original code's formatting.

Here's the further corrected patch for the older version:

I will now validate this further corrected patch to ensure it applies correctly to the older version.

 * get_hwpoison_page() - Get refcount for memory error handling
 * @p:		Raw error page (hit by memory error)

 *
 * get_hwpoison_page() takes a page refcount of an error page to handle memory
 * error on it, after checking that the error page is in a well-defined state
 * (defined as a page-type we can successfully handle the memory error on it,
 * such as LRU page and hugetlb page).
 *
 * Memory error handling could be triggered at any time on any type of page,
 * so it's prone to race with typical memory management lifecycle (like
 * allocation and free).  So to avoid such races, get_hwpoison_page() takes
 * extra care for the error page's state (as done in __get_hwpoison_page()),
 * and has some retry logic in get_any_page().
 *
 * When called from unpoison_memory(), the caller should already ensure that
 * the given page has PG_hwpoison. So it's never reused for other page
 * allocations, and __get_unpoison_page() never races with them.
 *
 * Return: 0 on failure,
 *         1 on success for in-use pages in a well-defined state,
 *         -EIO for pages on which we can not handle memory errors,

responded: The function `unmap_poisoned_folio` does not exist in the old version at ref `420102835862f49ec15c545594278dc5d2712f42`. The similar function `unmap_mapping_folio` is not directly related to the patch context. 

The `hwpoison_user_mappings` function in the old version contains the logic related to unmapping poisoned folios. The logic of checking if the folio is mapped and returning `-EBUSY` if it is mapped is already present in the `hwpoison_user_mappings` function in the older version. The function uses `page_mapped(p)` to check if the page is mapped and returns `unmap_success`, which is the inverse of `page_mapped(p)`.

Since the logic to check if the folio is mapped and return `-EBUSY` if it is mapped already exists in the `hwpoison_user_mappings` function in the older version, and there is no `unmap_poisoned_folio` function to modify, the patch does not need to be ported.

I will now validate that no backport is needed.

Author: Naoya Horiguchi <naoya.horiguchi@nec.com>

    mm/hwpoison: convert TTU_IGNORE_HWPOISON to TTU_HWPOISON
    
    After a memory error happens on a clean folio, a process unexpectedly
    receives SIGBUS when it accesses the error page.  This SIGBUS killing is
    pointless and simply degrades the level of RAS of the system, because the
    clean folio can be dropped without any data lost on memory error handling
    as we do for a clean pagecache.
    
    When memory_failure() is called on a clean folio, try_to_unmap() is called
    twice (one from split_huge_page() and one from hwpoison_user_mappings()).
    The root cause of the issue is that pte conversion to hwpoisoned entry is
    now done in the first call of try_to_unmap() because PageHWPoison is
    already set at this point, while it's actually expected to be done in the
    second call.  This behavior disturbs the error handling operation like
    removing pagecache, which results in the malfunction described above.
    
    So convert TTU_IGNORE_HWPOISON into TTU_HWPOISON and set TTU_HWPOISON only
    when we really intend to convert pte to hwpoison entry.  This can prevent
    other callers of try_to_unmap() from accidentally converting to hwpoison
    entries.

    mm/hwpoison: convert TTU_IGNORE_HWPOISON to TTU_HWPOISON
    
    After a memory error happens on a clean folio, a process unexpectedly
    receives SIGBUS when it accesses the error page.  This SIGBUS killing is
    pointless and simply degrades the level of RAS of the system, because the
    clean folio can be dropped without any data lost on memory error handling
    as we do for a clean pagecache.
    
    When memory_failure() is called on a clean folio, try_to_unmap() is called
    twice (one from split_huge_page() and one from hwpoison_user_mappings()).
    The root cause of the issue is that pte conversion to hwpoisoned entry is
    now done in the first call of try_to_unmap() because PageHWPoison is
    already set at this point, while it's actually expected to be done in the
    second call.  This behavior disturbs the error handling operation like
    removing pagecache, which results in the malfunction described above.
    
    So convert TTU_IGNORE_HWPOISON into TTU_HWPOISON and set TTU_HWPOISON only
    when we really intend to convert pte to hwpoison entry.  This can prevent
    other callers of try_to_unmap() from accidentally converting to hwpoison
    entries.

responded: The code in the older version at ref `420102835862f49ec15c545594278dc5d2712f42` closely matches the structure and logic of the code from the patch in the newer version. The function `hwpoison_user_mappings` in both versions handles poisoned pages, checking for `PageSwapCache`, and propagating the dirty bit.

### Differences and Observations:
1. **Function Signature and Parameters:**
   - In the older version, the function `hwpoison_user_mappings` takes parameters `struct page *p, unsigned long pfn, int flags, struct page *hpage`.
   - In the newer version, the function takes `struct folio *folio, struct page *p, unsigned long pfn, int flags`.

2. **Swap Cache Handling:**
   - The older version uses `PageSwapCache(p)` to check for swap cache.
   - The newer version uses `folio_test_swapcache(folio)`.
   - Both versions have the logic to unset `TTU_HWPOISON` if the page is in the swap cache.

3. **Mapping and Dirty Bit Handling:**
   - The older version uses `page_mapping(hpage)` and checks `!PageDirty(hpage)`.
   - The newer version uses `folio_mapping(folio)` and checks `!folio_test_dirty(folio)`.
   - Both versions have similar logic for handling the dirty bit and unsetting `TTU_HWPOISON`.

### Conclusion:
The logic for handling poisoned pages, swap cache, and the dirty bit is consistent between the two versions. The main differences are in the API and data structures (`page` vs. `folio`).

### Next Steps:
To backport the patch, I will create a patch for the older version that adapts the logic from the newer version to fit the older version's API and data structures. I will then validate the patch to ensure it applies cleanly and resolves the issue. Let's proceed with crafting the patch.

responded: To begin the process of backporting the patch, let's first review the provided patch for the newer version and the similar code block from the older version. This will help us understand the changes made and how they can be applied to the older version.

### Newer Version Patch Analysis:
The patch modifies the function `hwpoison_user_mappings` in `mm/memory-failure.c`. The key change is the replacement of two lines:
```diff
-	unmap_poisoned_folio(folio, ttu);
-	unmap_success = !folio_mapped(folio);
+	unmap_success = !unmap_poisoned_folio(folio, pfn, flags & MF_MUST_KILL);
```
This indicates a change in the function call to `unmap_poisoned_folio`, altering its parameters and the logic for determining `unmap_success`.

### Older Version Code Block:
The similar code block provided from the older version shows:
```c
try_to_unmap(folio, ttu);
unmap_success = !page_mapped(p);
```
This suggests that the function `try_to_unmap` is used instead of `unmap_poisoned_folio`, and `page_mapped` is used instead of `folio_mapped`.

### Next Steps:
1. Check the code change history to determine if the current snippet exists in the older version or if it has been modified over time. This will help us understand if the patch needs to be adapted or if it doesn't need to be ported at all.
2. Use `locate_symbol` to find where `unmap_poisoned_folio` is defined in the older version to see if it exists and what parameters it takes.
3. Use `viewcode` to examine the relevant portions of the code in the older version.
4. Craft a patch for the older version based on our findings.

Let's start by using `git_history` to check the code change history for the relevant lines in the older version. This will provide context on whether the code has changed or remained the same.

responded: The `git_history` output shows a series of changes that have occurred in the `mm/memory-failure.c` file. The changes primarily involve modifications to the function `hwpoison_user_mappings`, including the usage of `try_to_unmap` and `page_mapped`.

### Analysis:
1. **Code Logic Changes**: The logic involving `try_to_unmap` and `page_mapped` has been present for a while, but there are modifications regarding the parameters and the functions used, such as `folio_mapcount` and `page_mapcount`. This suggests that the logic of unmapping and checking mapping success has been consistent, but the specifics have evolved.

2. **Function Usage**: The function `unmap_poisoned_folio` used in the newer patch is not directly present in the older version. Instead, `try_to_unmap` and `page_mapped` are used. This indicates that the logic for unmapping and checking success needs to be adapted to the older function calls.

### Next Steps:
Given that the logic for unmapping and checking success is present but with different function calls, we need to:
1. **Locate `try_to_unmap` and `page_mapped`**: Check where these functions are defined or used to understand their parameters and usage context in the older version.
2. **View Code for Context**: Use `viewcode` to examine the relevant portions of the code in the older version to ensure the patch can be adapted correctly.

Let's start by using `locate_symbol` to find `try_to_unmap` and `page_mapped` in the older version to gather more context about their usage.

responded: The `try_to_unmap` function in `mm/rmap.c` attempts to remove all page table mappings to a folio. It uses a `rmap_walk_control` structure to manage the unmapping process, with `try_to_unmap_one` as the core function handling individual mappings.

### Observations:
- **Parameters**: `try_to_unmap` takes a `folio` and `flags` as parameters, which aligns with the logic seen in the older version's code block.
- **Logic**: The function uses `rmap_walk` or `rmap_walk_locked` based on the `flags` to perform the unmapping.

### Next Steps:
Since `try_to_unmap` does not directly return a success status, the older version uses `page_mapped` to determine if the page is still mapped. Let's now examine the `page_mapped` function in `mm/folio-compat.c` to understand its role in the mapping check.

responded: The `page_mapped` function in `mm/folio-compat.c` checks if a page is mapped by calling `folio_mapped` on the folio associated with the page. This aligns with the logic in the older version's code block, where `unmap_success` is determined using `!page_mapped(p)`.

### Observations:
- **Functionality**: `page_mapped` uses `folio_mapped` to determine if the page is still mapped, which is consistent with the logic in the older version.

### Crafting the Patch:
Based on our understanding, we need to adapt the newer patch's logic to the older version's context. In the newer patch, the function `unmap_poisoned_folio` is used with different parameters, and the success check is performed directly by this function. In the older version, we maintain the use of `try_to_unmap` and `page_mapped`.

Invoking: `git_history` with `{}`
responded: To backport the patch, I'll follow the workflow step by step:

1. **Review the Patch and Similar Code Blocks**: The patch modifies the `do_migrate_range` function in `mm/memory_hotplug.c`. Specifically, it changes the call to `unmap_poisoned_folio` by adding a `pfn` parameter and a `false` boolean value. The similar code block in the older version uses `try_to_unmap` instead of `unmap_poisoned_folio`.

2. **Use `git_history` to Check Code Change History**: This will help determine if the code block has been modified or moved in the past, which can influence how the backport is done.

Let's start by using `git_history`.

responded: The `git_history` shows that the last change to this code block was made in commit `e8a796fa1c16`, where `try_to_unmap(folio, TTU_IGNORE_MLOCK);` was replaced with `unmap_poisoned_folio(folio, TTU_IGNORE_MLOCK);`. This indicates that the logic for handling poisoned folios was introduced in this commit.

Since the function `unmap_poisoned_folio` was introduced in this commit, I need to check its presence and definition in the older version. I'll use `locate_symbol` to find where `unmap_poisoned_folio` is located in the older version (ref `420102835862f49ec15c545594278dc5d2712f42`). If it's not present, it may need to be implemented or adjusted according to the older version's logic.

Let's proceed with `locate_symbol` to check for `unmap_poisoned_folio` in the older version.

[0m[33;1m[1;3mThe symbol unmap_poisoned_folio you are looking for does not exist in the current ref.
But here is a symbol similar to it. It's `unmap_mapping_folio`.
The file where this symbol is located is: 
mm/internal.h:656
mm/memory.c:3565
Please be careful to check that this symbol indicates the same thing as the previous symbol.

responded: The function `unmap_poisoned_folio` does not exist in the older version, but there's a similar function called `unmap_mapping_folio`. This suggests that `unmap_poisoned_folio` might have been introduced or renamed in the newer version. To proceed, I need to verify if `unmap_mapping_folio` serves a similar purpose or if I need to implement the logic of `unmap_poisoned_folio` in the older version.

I'll start by checking the definition and usage of `unmap_mapping_folio` in the older version to see if it aligns with the purpose of `unmap_poisoned_folio`. I'll use `viewcode` to examine `unmap_mapping_folio` in `mm/memory.c` around line 3565.

responded: The function `unmap_mapping_folio` is used to unmap a single folio from processes, which seems to have a similar purpose to `unmap_poisoned_folio`. However, it doesn't directly match the logic of handling poisoned folios, as indicated by the patch for the newer version.

Since `unmap_poisoned_folio` doesn't exist in the older version and `unmap_mapping_folio` doesn't seem to handle poisoned folios specifically, I need to determine how to adapt the logic for poisoned folios in the older version. This might involve implementing a similar function or modifying existing logic to accommodate the changes.

Before making any changes, I should check if there's any existing logic related to handling poisoned folios in the older version. I'll look at the `do_migrate_range` function in the older version to see if there's any relevant logic that can be adapted.

Let's proceed with `viewcode` to examine `do_migrate_range` in `mm/memory_hotplug.c` around the similar code block provided earlier.

responded: The code snippet from `do_migrate_range` in the older version includes logic for handling hardware-poisoned pages using `try_to_unmap(folio, TTU_IGNORE_MLOCK);`. This aligns with the context of the patch for the newer version, where `unmap_poisoned_folio` is called instead.

To backport the patch, I need to adapt this logic to match the newer version's logic. Specifically, I need to replace `try_to_unmap(folio, TTU_IGNORE_MLOCK);` with a function that handles poisoned folios similarly to `unmap_poisoned_folio`. Since `unmap_poisoned_folio` is not present, I'll need to create a similar function or modify `try_to_unmap` to handle the `pfn` and `false` parameters.

Let's proceed with crafting the patch based on the observed logic and changes needed. I'll create a patch that modifies `do_migrate_range` to call a function handling poisoned folios, similar to `unmap_poisoned_folio`. If necessary, I'll create a new function to encapsulate this logic.

Here's the patch I'm considering:

```diff

 		}
```

Now, I'll use `validate` to test this patch on the older version to ensure it applies correctly and resolves the issue.

responded: The error message indicates that there's an invalid use of a void expression and an implicit declaration of the function `unmap_poisoned_folio`. This suggests that the function `unmap_poisoned_folio` may not be properly defined or declared in the older version. Let's address these issues:

1. Ensure that `unmap_poisoned_folio` is properly declared in the header file.
2. Correct the use of `try_to_unmap` in `unmap_success = !try_to_unmap(folio, ttu);`.

Let's revise the patch accordingly:
